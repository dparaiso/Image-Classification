## Summary 
A 4-layer neural network for image classification between cat and non-cat photos, the forward propagation process can be summarized as:

Input Layer: Receives the image data.
1. Hidden Layer 1: Linear transformation -> ReLU activation.
2. Hidden Layer 2: Linear transformation -> ReLU activation.
3. Hidden Layer 3: Linear transformation -> ReLU activation.
4. Output Layer: Linear transformation -> Sigmoid activation.
This sequence of operations allows the network to learn and make predictions about whether an input image contains a cat or not.

The following is a diagram which shows the inner workings of the neural network.
